## ⚙️ Mail.tm Integration

> This service is currently optimized for [Mail.tm](https://docs.mail.tm/)

- **Base URL:** `https://api.mail.tm`
- **API Key:** Use `NO_API_KEY`
- Email accounts and inboxes are deleted securely after use via their REST API.

---

## Privacy & Security

- No tracking or data collection
- Everything happens in the browser
- Session data (email, tokens, inbox) cleared on exit
- Temp emails are deleted via API when possible

---

## Tips

- Extend your session using the "+30 Min" button if you're still using the email
- Use "Destroy Session" to manually nuke everything
- Do **not** use this for anything sensitive — it’s still temp mail
